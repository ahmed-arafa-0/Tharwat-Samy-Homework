/*
Question 15
What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used?
*/

/*
Dart is statically-typed, meaning variable types are checked at compile-time rather than at runtime. 
This ensures that type errors are caught early, leading to safer and more reliable code.

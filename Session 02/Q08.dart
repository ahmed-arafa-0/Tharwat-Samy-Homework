Question 8
What is the difference between the num and double data types in Dart?
*/

/*
Num : Can assign to the variable any of Interger or double values

double: Can assign to the variable double values only and if you assign
to it Integer value, it will convert it to double by adding .0 in the end
of the number Ex: double myNum = 123 => myNum = 123.0
